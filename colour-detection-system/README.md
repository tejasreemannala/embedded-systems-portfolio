# Colour Detection System Using Arduino and TCS3200

## Overview
This project implements a color detection system capable of identifying colors based on RGB values obtained from a TCS3200 color sensor interfaced with an Arduino microcontroller.

---

## Objective
To detect and identify colors accurately using frequency-based RGB sensing.

---

## System Description
The TCS3200 sensor converts color intensity into frequency signals. These signals are read by the microcontroller and mapped to RGB values. Based on predefined thresholds, the system identifies the detected color.
