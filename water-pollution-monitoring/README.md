# GPS-Based River Water Pollution Monitoring System

## Overview
This project involves the development of an embedded system to monitor river water quality using sensors and associate the collected data with GPS coordinates. The system aims to support environmental monitoring by enabling location-based pollution analysis.

---

## Objective
To design a portable embedded system capable of measuring water quality parameters and tagging them with geographical location data.

---

## System Description
Water quality sensors such as pH and turbidity sensors are interfaced with a microcontroller. A GPS module is used to capture the location of the sampling point. Sensor readings are collected and processed to provide insight into pollution levels at specific locations.
